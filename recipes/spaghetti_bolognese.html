          Bolognese. This beloved Italian dish features al dente spaghetti

          along with a blend of herbs and spices, creating a deeply flavorful
          and hearty accompaniment to the pasta. Top it off with a sprinkle of

        <h2>How to make Spaghetti Bolognese</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            In a large pot, cook the spaghetti noodles according to the package
            instructions until al dente. Drain and set aside.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a separate large skillet or saucepan, heat olive oil over medium
            heat. Add the chopped onion and minced garlic, saut√©ing until they
            turn translucent and fragrant.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the ground beef to the skillet and cook until browned, breaking
            it up into smaller pieces with a wooden spoon.
          </li>
          <li>
            Stir in the Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper, adjusting the
            amounts to your taste. Mix well to incorporate the flavors.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add the canned tomatoes, tomato paste, beef or vegetable broth, and
            red wine (if using). Stir well to combine all the ingredients.
          </li>
          <li>
            Reduce the heat to low and let the sauce simmer uncovered for about
            30 minutes to allow the flavors to meld together and the sauce to
            thicken. Stir occasionally.
          </li>
          <li>
            Taste the sauce and adjust the seasonings as needed. Add more salt,
            pepper, or Italian seasoning if desired.
          </li>
          <li>
            Serve the cooked spaghetti noodles with a generous ladle of the
            Bolognese sauce on top. Garnish with grated Parmesan cheese and
            fresh basil or parsley.
          </li>
          <li>
            Toss the spaghetti and sauce together until well combined, ensuring
            that the noodles are evenly coated with the sauce.
          </li>
          <li>
            Serve hot and enjoy the rich and comforting flavors of Spaghetti
            Bolognese.
