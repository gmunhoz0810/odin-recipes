    <h2>How to make delicious Lasagna</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat the oven to the recommended temperature for baking lasagna.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Saut√© the chopped
        onion and minced garlic until translucent and fragrant.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the ground meat to the skillet and cook until browned, breaking it
        up into smaller pieces with a wooden spoon.
      </li>
      <li>
        Season the meat with Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper. Stir well to
        incorporate the flavors.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the marinara sauce into the skillet, stirring it into the meat
        mixture. Allow the sauce to simmer gently for a few minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        In a separate bowl, combine the ricotta cheese with a portion of grated
        Parmesan cheese. Mix well until fully incorporated.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom of a baking dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place a layer of lasagna sheets on top of the sauce, covering the entire
        bottom of the dish.
      </li>
      <li>
        Spread a layer of the ricotta cheese mixture over the lasagna sheets,
        followed by a layer of mozzarella cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Repeat the layers, alternating between the meat sauce, lasagna sheets,
        ricotta cheese mixture, and mozzarella cheese until the ingredients are
        used up, ending with a layer of mozzarella cheese on top.
      </li>
      <li>Sprinkle additional grated Parmesan cheese over the top layer.</li>
      <li>
        Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil, ensuring it is tightly sealed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place the dish in the preheated oven and bake for the recommended time,
        or until the lasagna sheets are tender and the cheese is melted and
        bubbly.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once cooked, remove the foil and allow the lasagna to rest for a few
        minutes before serving.
      </li>
      <li>Garnish with fresh basil leaves, if desired.</li>
      <li>
        Slice and serve the lasagna while it's still warm, savoring each
        delectable layer of flavors.
